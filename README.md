# Ampliform

Like devalue but for form data handles:

- undefined
- Infinity
- NaN
- -0
- regular expressions
- dates
- Map and Set
- BigInt
- File
- URL
<!-- - TypedArray (Uint8Array, Int8Array, Uint16Array, Int16Array, Uint32Array, Int32Array, Float32Array, Float64Array)
- ArrayBuffer -->

< 1kb minified and gzipped.

Less performant than devalue but as performant as superjson.
